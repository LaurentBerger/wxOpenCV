    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software

The text of this license is given in the file COPYING.LIB in the
distribution directory.  Exceptions are noted below.

The intent behind distributing PLplot under the LGPL is to ensure that it
continues to evolve in a positive way, while remaining freely
distributable.  The package is considered a "library" even though there
are associated programs, such as plrender, pltek, plserver, and pltcl.
The ties between these programs and the library are so great that I
consider them as part of the library, so distribution under the terms of
the LGPL makes sense.  Software developers are allowed and encouraged to
use PLplot as an integral part of their product, even a commercial
product.  Under the conditions of the LGPL, however, the PLplot source
code must remain freely available, including any modifications you make to
it (if you distribute a program based on the modified library).  Please
read the full license for more info.


Additional Copyrights
---------------------

The octave front end which links to the PLplot library (but not vice versa),
and which is otherwise independent of PLplot is copyright under the GPL
license (see COPYING).

The startup code used in argument handling (utils/plrender.c and
src/plargs.c) is partially derived from "xterm.c" of the X11R5
distribution, and its copyright is reproduced here:
